Implementation of a RAL as a "Ternary Tree"
===========================================

In my CSE 382 - "Functional Programming Data Structures and Patterns" class, we learned about an implementation of Random Acces Lists (RALs) in Erlang. I was curious if this could be implemented as a single tree rather than a list of trees. This is my implementation of that idea.

The implementation of the RAL was excluded from this repository, since it comes from the solution for an assignment in the course. I want to ensure that I adhere to my university's policies on Academic Honesty. I believe that the RAL we used in class is based on something similar to the one shown in (this article by Chris Okesaki)[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.55.5156&rep=rep1&type=pdf].
